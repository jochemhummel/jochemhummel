## Overview
My research focuses on understanding the organizing mechanisms and processes used by organizations in **complex interorganizational collaborations** to pursue broad goals related to **digital innovation**. My first priority lies with doing highly rigorous, qualitative, empirical research. For example, my dissertation research concerns a longitudinal study of a collaboration between "big science" and "big business: called [Helix Nebula](http://helix-nebula.eu), where I analyze how large scientific institutes (CERN, EMBL, ESA) collaborate with commercial cloud computing organizations (Atos, T-Systems), and public infrastructure providers (EGI, GEANT), to develop a **European scientific cloud computing infrastructure**. 
  
I am a passionate **qualitative researcher** (case study and ethnographic methods). I typically do **process research**, and through my interest in **micro-level dynamics** I also have knowledge of **practice theory**. 
Driven by my determination for methodological rigor I have adopted **digital methods for qualitative data** as a complementary analysis technique.
